# Graduation Project - Mobile App (Frontend)

## ✨ About the Project
This repository contains the frontend part of our graduation project built using **Flutter**.

## 👩‍💻 Frontend Development (by Shahd)
All UI screens are being implemented and updated in a separate branch to avoid conflicts with the backend integration.

- **Frontend branch**: `ui-updates`
- Please avoid pushing directly to `main` for frontend changes.
- You can check the latest screens and designs in `lib/screens/`

## 🧠 Backend Team Notes
- If you're working on API integration, please use the `main` branch or create a backend-specific branch.
- Do not edit or override any UI files directly.
- If you need any screen updates or design adjustments, please open an issue or contact Shahd.

## 🔀 How to Merge Later?
When frontend development is complete or ready for review:
1. A pull request will be created from `ui-updates` to `main`
2. The team can review changes together before merging

> 📌 This approach helps keep frontend and backend work separated and organized without any conflicts.
